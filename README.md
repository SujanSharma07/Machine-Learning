Machine learning using sklearn Python





raw_health_NN.py shows the neural network implementaion without NN API like tensorflow/keras/sklearn
you can learn Neural Network from basisc level through this file and implement it in more optimized way like in heart_disease folder.


inside heart_disease folder...Their can be pre trailed model preserved as pikel file and authentic training conception are in commit blocks.
